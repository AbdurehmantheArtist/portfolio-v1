                <p class="par">I go by Abdul Rahman Yusuf from Chak hotiana, Bahawalnagar, Punjab, Pakistan. I loved drawing, since my childhood, but I officially delved into it in 6th grade when I moved to my town school from City. I got better in it, day by day, drawing for hours. It has been 7 years since I started drawing seriously. Now i have around 3 or 4 years experience as a professional Artist. I draw on custom orders  other than drawing something on my own. you can look at my artworks in the Drawings tab.    Well 3d modelling it has been around more than 2 years. I made cars mostly using blender but nowadays I only create footwear designs on Blender. You can check them out in the 3Dblender tab.  Well, writing is another passion of mine. I always wanted to write down something. Else than drawing i always was thinking about stories and ideas of my own. I officially started writing a novel 4 years ago but it didn't go well as i couldn't finish. Then after a few months i started again and finally  i finished one named Boneer. A short story it was that had around 7thousand words. I posted it on Wattpad. After that i wrote various short stories. You can read them in writing tab. Nowadays i am working on My most precious novel JAPTRA. I completed the first draft of it in a year that has 74k words. An adventure, ancient, sci fi, mystery Novel. I am improving my draft so it can be published in future, InshAllah</p>
